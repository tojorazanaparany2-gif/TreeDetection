# TreeDetection

A Python tool for processing large GeoTIFF images by slicing them into smaller tiles, running YOLO object detection, and generating both a stitched output image and a shapefile of detections.

## Overview

This tool is designed to handle large GeoTIFF images by breaking them down into manageable tiles, running YOLO object detection on each tile, and then reassembling them into a complete image. It also generates a shapefile containing the geographic coordinates of all detections. The tool can be used either through a command-line interface or a web interface.

## Features

- Slice large GeoTIFF images into smaller tiles
- Run YOLO object detection on each tile
- Draw detection boxes on the processed images
- Generate a shapefile of detection coordinates
- Preserve original GeoTIFF metadata and coordinate system
- Web interface for easy file upload and processing
- Command-line interface for batch processing

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Required packages:
  - numpy
  - PIL (Python Imaging Library)
  - rasterio
  - fiona
  - shapely
  - ultralytics (YOLO)
  - flask (for web interface)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConservationDronesAI/TreeDetection.git
   cd TreeDetection
   ```

### Using Conda

1. Create a new conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n TreeDetection python=3.10
   ```

2. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate TreeDetection
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   python webapp.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Upload a GeoTIFF file through the web interface
4. The tool will process the image and provide download links for:
   - The stitched GeoTIFF with detection boxes
   - The shapefile containing detection coordinates

### Command Line Interface

The main script `EndToEnd.py` provides a complete pipeline for image processing:

```python
from EndToEnd import run_end_to_end

run_end_to_end(
    original_tiff_path='path/to/input.tif',
    sliced_dir='sliced_tiles',
    detected_dir='detected_tiles',
    output_tiff_path='outputs/stitched_output.tif',
    output_shp_path='outputs/detections.shp',
    tile_size=(512, 512),  # Optional: customize tile size
    model_path='best.pt',  # Optional: specify YOLO model
    conf=0.3  # Optional: detection confidence threshold
)
```

## File Structure

- `EndToEnd.py`: Main processing script
- `webapp.py`: Web interface implementation
- `best.pt`: YOLO model weights
- `uploads/`: Directory for uploaded files
- `outputs/`: Directory for final output files
- `sliced_tiles/`: Directory for intermediate sliced tiles
- `detected_tiles/`: Directory for processed tiles with detections

## Output Files

1. **Stitched GeoTIFF**: Contains the original image with detection boxes drawn on it
   - Preserves all original GeoTIFF metadata
   - Maintains the original coordinate system
   - Detection boxes are drawn in red

2. **Shapefile**: Contains the geographic coordinates of all detections
   - Includes .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files
   - Uses the same coordinate system as the input GeoTIFF
   - Each detection is stored as a polygon feature

## Notes

- The tool uses YOLO for object detection, which requires a trained model (provided as `best.pt`)
- Make sure to have sufficient disk space for the intermediate files
- The web interface is intended for development/testing; for production use, consider adding proper security measures
- The shapefile output requires all associated files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) to be used properly in GIS software
